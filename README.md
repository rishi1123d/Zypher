# Zypher - Zero-Knowledge Identity Verification Protocol

Zypher is a next-generation identity verification protocol that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to combat AI-generated synthetic fraud. Our solution provides a privacy-preserving, mathematically verifiable way to authenticate identity claims without exposing sensitive personal data.

## Problem Statement

With the rise of AI-generated synthetic fraud:
- 80% of financial institutions still rely on document-based verification
- Synthetic identity fraud causes $20B-$40B in annual losses
